How web frontends are built.

...Except you can build web frontends in a variety of different ways, each having their trade-offs, and you should
choose different options depending on the _purpose_.

## The current paradigm

As of 2025:

Want to make a personal site, or just simple website - maybe with some commercial features?  
Use a Website builder with an easy hosting option (e.g. Squarespace, Wix, etc.).

Want to make a site where you have more control over the site structure and content - e.g. more advanced user wanting to
customize a blog, journalistic website, etc.?  
Use a CMS (WordPress, Drupal, etc.) and host it through a CMS-hosting provider or on your own webserver (self-hosted
or managed) if you're comfortable with that.

Want to make an easy-to-manage ecommerce website?  
Use an ecommerce website building & hosting platform (Squarespace, Shopify, etc.).

Want to make something more custom / original, either because you're offering a service, or you just want to showcase
web development skills?  
Make a custom site and host it yourself.

Custom site tech stack, in 2025:

| Component / Requirement | Solution                                                                                       |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Programming language    | TypeScript                                                                                     |
| Framework               | Next.js / React - mix of Server & Client components as necessary                               |
| Styling                 | Tailwind + some vanilla CSS + {your-favourite-charting-library} (e.g. D3.js, Highcharts)       |
| Linting                 | ESLint + Prettier + Husky (pre-commit hooks)                                                   |
| Testing                 | Jest or Vitest, with Mock Service Worker                                                       |
| Build Tools             | npm + Turbopack                                                                                |
| Accessibility           | W3C Accessibility Standards, works with screen readers, light/dark/system/colour-blind theming |
| Common libraries        | swr/fetch for client-side fetching, date-fns for date management                               |
| Content Management      | Headless CMS + a CDN                                                                           |
| Hosting                 | Serverless or Kubernetes (containerized)                                                       |

## Paradigm Shifts

While the "backend" world has a bunch of different programming languages and choices, each programming language
ecosystem offers a relatively unchanging set of standard frameworks/tools.

This is not the case for the web frontend ecosystem, which instead changes technologies and philosophy quite often -
occasionally even returning to previously adopted methodologies but with a different technology stack. I've heard these
moves be referred to as "paradigm shifts".

From an inside and outside perspective, these paradigm shifts can be exciting and frustrating for a myriad of reasons. I
hope that the ecosystem eventually settles (and there are some technologies that the ecosystem seems to be settling on).

Below, I have documented the paradigm shifts (from my perspective) over time:

TODO: More writing of this ðŸ‘‡ - cover things like npm vs yarn vs pnpm, Hooks, Server Components, etc.

- Late 80s / Early 90s = Static sites.
- Mid-90s: HTML, CSS & JS - JavaScript used for simple client-side interactivity.
- Web 2.0 = Dynamic sites (or "webapps") (more advanced interactivity, dynamic content driven by backend systems)
- Late-90s: CGI-languages like PHP or Perl for server-side rendering.
- Early-00s: PHP, Java, C# for server-side rendering.
- Late-00s:
    - HTML5 and jQuery brought for more advanced client-side manipulation.
    - SCSS (a CSS pre-processor) introduced to make CSS styling easier.
- Early-10s: Shift to client-side rendering and "single page applications", driven by APIs.
    - Bootstrap introduced to making styling simpler with Bootstrap CSS classes.
    - AngularJS or React brought a shift from JavaScript being a language that manipulates the HTML, to being JavaScript
      controls and renders (on the client-side) the DOM.
    - Node.js and Express.js introduced to allow developers to begin writing backend systems in JavaScript.
    - npm introduced as a dependency/project management tool for building JavaScript projects (both for browser and
      Node.js)
- Mid- and Late-10s:
    - Angular2 introduced, as well as other frameworks like Vue and Ember, but React ends up leading the industry.
- Late-10s:
    - React is dominant.
    - CSS-in-JS styling gaining prevalence.
- Early-20s:
    - Next.js (and other Vercel-driven technologies) starts gaining dominance as the React technologies of choice.
- Mid-20s:
    - Now!

## My personal preferences

Granted most of this either doesn't exist or "kind of" exists, or if it does exist, it might not be the industry
standard:

- A *real* typed language for client-side scripting (no TypeScript pre-compilation stuff).
- A simple way to handle both server-side rendering and client-side rendering, that makes it clear which "components"
  are rendered where, and makes modifications easy.
- Mostly server-side rendered content, with some sections of pages being client-side rendered (with pre-rendering) for
  better user experience.
- Robust shift-left testing, with contract testing.
- Runtime mocking for purely local development.
- No monorepos. 1 webapp = 1 repo (possibly have "micro-frontends" for very large websites with multiple systems).
- Properly managed SemVer libraries.
- Vanilla CSS styling packaged close to "components", but backed by a styling library for easier development.
- Single tool for project management (e.g. npm)
- Headless CMS and CDN for content management.
- W3C Accessibility Standards, works with screen readers, light/dark/system/colour-blind theming.
- Minimal maintenance and need for refactoring (relies on a stable ecosystem)

### Testing and Local Development

I'm a big proponent of doing thorough testing, shifting left on testing, and developing systems "locally" on your
computer (for the most part). This lowers the barrier of entry for contributing to a project, and can massively simplify
the testing and development of systems (no complex CI/CD pipelines needed, no test environments needed or test data to
manage, and no special knowledge needed to convey).

Ideally, a developer/engineer should be able to:

1. Have a computer with some relevant software installed (usually a package manager at minimum).
2. Clone the project repository.
3. Install the dependencies for the project, with a single command.
4. Run the application locally, connecting to runtime mocks, with a single command.
5. Write and run the tests for the application locally, also connecting to mocks when needed, with a single command.
6. Be able to build a production-grade artifact of the application, with a single command.

Further testing and system analysis like performance testing, security testing, application profiling or analysis may
need extra tools or a dedicated environment in order be done.

For some reason, this is often not the case for frontend ecosystems. Instead, the ecosystem commonly has test
environments with test data and deployed backend APIs to connect to, complex end-to-end tests, integrated tests, and a
consistent lack of mocks and thorough test suites.

Testing web frontends can be done, by doing:

- Code analysis / linting to ensure:
    - Accessible code styling is used.
    - Common standards are followed.
    - Bugs / Code smells / Security vulnerabilities are spotted and fixed.
    - Language/feature compatibility with supported browsers.
- Unit testing all functions (mocking components).
- Integration testing API integrations using mocks (ideally enabling contract testing to be possible).
- Accessibility testing the UI.
- UI testing to ensure unexpected changes to the UI are not introduced (this can be automated to a point, but often
  needs to be manual to just make sure UIs "look right". Individual common UI components can be put into a separate
  library and automated UI testing performed there to reduce the UI testing overhead for applications using those UI
  components.)
- End-to-End testing (with mocks) critical user flows (minimise these!).
